        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a highly dependable and friendly individual with a proven track record of managing multiple responsibilities effectively and efficiently, all while maintaining a professional and positive attitude. I'm known for being adaptable and open to taking on new challenges, and I'm dedicated to using all available resources and strategies to meet both team and company goals. With a strong commitment to success, I excel in environments that require flexibility, creativity, and problem-solving. In addition to being task-oriented, I have exceptional communication and interpersonal skills, which help me foster positive relationships with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders. My ability to work well in team settings and engage with others with respect and empathy makes me a valuable asset to any organization. I'm also meticulous in my work, paying close attention to detail to ensure accuracy and high-quality results in all tasks I undertake. I take pride in delivering consistent, reliable outcomes. I thrive in fast-paced and dynamic environments, demonstrating a remarkable ability to prioritize, remain organized, and meet deadlines without compromising quality. My commitment to growth, adaptability, and continuous improvement makes me an ideal addition to any team looking for a dedicated, personable, and results-driven individual to contribute to their success.<br><br>

        Currently expecting a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from the University of California, Riverside, I have developed a strong foundation in understanding social dynamics, human behavior, and societal structures. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained valuable insight into topics such as social inequalities, cultural diversity, and the impact of policy on communities. I have honed critical thinking, research, and analytical skills, equipping me to address complex social issues from an informed and empathetic perspective. 

At UC Riverside, I’ve been involved in various projects and coursework that have enhanced my ability to analyze social trends, communicate effectively, and collaborate with peers from diverse backgrounds. I am eager to apply this academic knowledge to real-world scenarios, bringing a deep understanding of human behavior and social systems into professional settings. My degree prepares me to contribute meaningfully to both community-focused and organizational efforts aimed at fostering positive social change.<br><br>

        I am skilled in video editing using platforms such as Video Star (mobile) and Adobe After Effects (Mac). Since early 2019, I have been editing videos for fun and entertainment, sharing my work on social media, mainly Instagram and Twitter, to engage and connect with others. Through this experience, I have developed a strong understanding of video production and editing techniques. Also, I am a patient and friendly individual who works well with others and fosters a welcoming atmosphere in team settings. I am quick to focus on tasks and always ready to help or learn new skills to enhance my work. Additionally, I am bilingual, fluent in both English and my native Spanish. This language proficiency allows me to communicate effectively with a diverse range of people and collaborate across different cultural contexts. My combination of technical video editing skills and interpersonal abilities makes me a versatile asset in creative environments.
